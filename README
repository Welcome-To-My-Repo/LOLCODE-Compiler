This is a compiler for the LOLCODE esoteric language.

It works in both windows and linux

Building the compiler requires the Make utility and the GNU Toolchain.
Navigate to the directory containing the source files.
For Windows, enter "make Win"
For Linux, enter "make Linux"

Currently, neither building in Linux or Windows is supported. In fact,
compiler doesn't even run as it's not finished. Stay tuned!
